# Home assignment

### **Situation**

You will be asked to develop a python function that will return a message. As example you have the function below:

### **Assignment**

You will be advised to follow the material included in [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python\_functions.asp) and [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/functions-python-tutorial); proceed to create an account in [Repl.it](https://replit.com/\~); write the function, which should either prompt the user for a name or take it as parameter, then print out a personalised "Hello" response, like "Hello Jose". Otherwise, the function will print out "Hello World"

Once you have written and downloaded the python function file, you can send it in a reply to **simon@migracode.org.**

### **Resolution**

We will let you know as soon as possible if you have passed this step and if you will be accepted to our course.&#x20;

Thank you in advance and let us know if you have any questions.
