# Structure

## Structure of the program

This program counts with 6 courses that will improve your IT foundations to help you take your career to the next level. The content is highly interactive and exclusively developed by Google employees with decades of experience in IT. Each course is divided into modules dedicated to concrete subjects. Through a mix of videos, assessments, and hands-on labs, you’ll be introduced to foundational IT skills required for an entry-level job.

## 100% online

The course itself is 100% online which means you will need a computer. It can be a basic computer - it doesn’t have to be an expensive/strong one. We encourage you to work from home on your own computer, but if you are not (always) able to do so, you can discuss the possibility to either lend a laptop (if we have availability) or to work from the Open Cultural Center (OCC) office (C/Rec, 27 08003 Barcelona).

## Platforms & Tools

### Coursera

The courses are delivered by Coursera, an online learning platform that will provide you with all the content of the program.

### Slack

The channel-based messaging platform that we use as our main communication tool. Many tech companies also use Slack and it is a huge advantage to have Slack skills when you apply for jobs in tech.

## Self-learning approach

This program is based on autonomous learning. Autonomous learning revolves around students being responsible for themselves. As a student, you will be able to manage your study hours and customize your way of learning to adapt it to your own needs. But do not worry, you will not be alone in this. The mentor and a group of specialized tech volunteers will be by your side to provide support, advice, and knowledge when asked.&#x20;

_**However, it is very important to be proactive: ask for help when you are stuck, inform your mentor when you have issues, and do not hesitate to use Slack to get help with the course.**_

## **Main support**

#### Specialized volunteers

Migracode counts with a community of tech professional volunteers and students who will be willing to help you with any issue or any questions you have. You will be able to reach them at any time via Slack. Your mentor will explain Slack during the onboarding session,

#### Your personal mentor

The mentor - Simón -, will be the main contact person. He will help you to design your learning plan at the beginning, introduce you to the different platforms and guide you throughout the process. You will have a regular meeting with him - depending on your learning plan -, listen to your feedback and make sure everything is going as planned. The meetings will take place online or in-person at the office of OCC depending on your availability. You can contact him via email [simon@migracode.org](mailto:joana@migracode.org) or via Slack.&#x20;
