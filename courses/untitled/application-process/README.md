## **The Application process**

### **Step 1 - Apply online**

Apply through our [website.](https://migracode.openculturalcenter.org/it-support-security-course/) In the form, **you will be asked to fill in some personal data and to write a short motivation why you want to join this course.**

This part is already extremely important! **Motivation is the strongest aspect of our course**, as you will need to work a lot to complete our program. After sending the form, we will reply to you as soon as possible to inform you if you can continue with step 2.

### **Step 2 - Home assignment**&#x20;

Step 2 is the most difficult step and you will need to take your time for it. **It requires making a small home assignment.**

The assignment consists of the following:

* You will receive a simulated question from a customer about a technical issue.
* Your task is to answer the customer in the best way possible!
* After you wrote your answer to this customer, you send it to us by email.

You can find the assignment [here. ](home-assignment.md)

### **Step 3 - Interview**&#x20;

Once we have received your work, we will let you know **if you have passed the assignment** and if so, we will invite you to an **online interview.**&#x20;

After a few days, we will inform you about the result of the interview.&#x20;

### **Step 4 - Onboarding session**&#x20;

The final part of the application process is **to come to our office in Barcelona** to get to know us in person and to receive **a comprehensive introduction** to MigraCode Barcelona.

You will get help installing the required software on your laptop, we will explain to you the main tools that we use during the course and we explain **other practical information about MigraCode.**

Once this is done, **you are ready to start with the course right away!**
