# Planning and Calendar

## Calendar

The Final project is done in 7 weeks, including the Demo Day event and the Graduation in the last week, which means that finally the students will have only 6 weeks to work on the project.

Three weeks before the Final project kick-off, teams will be decided and will start "thinking" in their project.

All the classes will be in the assigned Weekday (normally Tuesday or Wednesday), and on Saturday we will not have class. Check the next calendar and see that also we don't have classes the 3rd and 5th week.

No general classes do not mean that the teams are not working, it means that all the teams do not have a common meeting, teams can use the same hours to have team meetings, check Team Weekly Plan for more details.
