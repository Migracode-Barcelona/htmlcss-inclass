# Call for project ideas

## Scope

What we can do in the final projects is a simple version of a Web Application, that we can call "Minimum Valuable Product (MVP)" or prototype.

To think about the idea and scope to develop, we need to have in mind the following points:

* [x] We have only 6 weeks to work in the project to develop the project
* [x] The main objective of the final project, is learning and put into practice the Web Development concepts they acquired (front-end, back-end and databases).&#x20;
* [x] The output of the project, could be a tool that improves a process in the organization or a new idea, that can register information through different forms, with different types of users and different functionalities.

What we do not as a final project:

* [ ] Native mobile application for Android or i-Phone. What we can generally do are responsive Web Applications, that could be visited from a Mobile or a Desktop.
* [ ] Web Sites. A Web Site that can be done with wordpress is not the objective of the Web Development course,&#x20;

## Projects for NGO's and third parties

At MigraCode try to find interesting, tech-for-good projects for that stretch the abilities of our students whilst helping an NGO or Charity solve a problem they are facing.

Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) and Third parties focused on improve people lives are not indifferent to digitalization and start to increase their investment to technology. In almost every aspect of life and work, we can see the effects, institutions cannot be independent of this 'digital life', with new habits brought by digitalization. Every time more, digitalization is fundamental for NGOs and third parties to cover their processes and optimize human resources.&#x20;

What MigraCode offers to NGOs, is a tool to improve the performance, covering manual processes done by email, in an Excel Sheet or in a paper. Like:

* Look and register new volunteers and assign them
* Web Page with forms that users can fill, and there is a process to do with the information
* A typical process that now is done in an Excel sheet, and it is not enough
