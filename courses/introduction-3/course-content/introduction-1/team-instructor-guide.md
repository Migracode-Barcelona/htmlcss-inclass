## Team Weekly Meetings

We’re going to run the final projects in weekly “sprints”, planning out what we’re going to do as teams and as individuals. Each week will therefore look something like:

* **Daily standup**: post a daily message in the team Slack channel to let the rest of the team know what you’re working on, what progress you’ve made (even, and perhaps _especially_, if it’s none so far) and share anything that’s blocking you. Set a time for this and stick to it. Afterwards, post a team summary in the main class channel.
* **Mid-week check-in**: you should have at least one Slack call with the whole team and a mentor during the week to sync on progress, escalate any blockers and make sure that you’re still heading in the right direction.
