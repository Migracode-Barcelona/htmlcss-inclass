# Methodology

## **Introduction**

This is the first time we will build a software product, but how do we start? Do we create a file in Visual Studio and write the first lines of code? Do we draw and write everything like in a building plan before start coding?

Build a software product doesn't require the same specification as a building, but you will have to make some questions before start coding, like:

1. What are the requirements?
2. What budget/time/resources do we have to do it?
3. How could be the product to give an answer to those requirements?
