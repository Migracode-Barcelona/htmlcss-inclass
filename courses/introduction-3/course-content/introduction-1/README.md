# Final Projects

{% hint style="success" %}
In the _Final Project_, we will emulate a development project in a real company, working together in teams using **** an **agile methodology, SCRUM** and the most used tools like **Slack, Trello, Git, Zoom** and more, to build an idea from scratch to finally have a Minimum Viable Product (**MVP**) deployed in a public link.
{% endhint %}

Some details:

* **Team**: group of 3-4 students and an experienced mentor, one of the students will have the role of _Team Leader_. Every team will develop an independent project.
* **MVP**: A Minimum Viable Product is a product with enough features to attract early-adopter customers and validate a product idea early in the product development cycle
* **Software Stack**: In this _Final Project_, we will build a full-stack prototype using the complete stack we learned ->  (HTML+CSS+Javascript+React+Node+Express+Postgre SQL)
* **Duration:** 7 weeks&#x20;



## **Objectives**

During the Project you will work on your technical and communication skills. At the end of this module you'll learn the following:

### **Technical skills**

* [x] How to `build a complete full-stack application`
* [x] Understanding `how each part of an application relates` to each other
* [x] What it means to work on a `feature`
* [x] How to work with `Git` in a team setting
* [x] How to write `readable code`

### **Communication skills**

* [x] How to `communicate effectively` with team members
* [x] `Keeping track` of your project's progress
* [x] Knowing if you `understand what's asked` of you
* [x] How to `communicate with non-developers` about what you're doing
* [x] Learning how to be `solutions-oriented`
* [x] How to work in a `Agile setting`

Finally you will have a nice project to add to your portfolio

## Students Testimonials

Comments of the Final Project from students:

> _"Thanks to the final project and my team, during this process I understood how I can use together all the modules learned. I could realize that just with a nice idea, basic HTML, CSS, node and database is possible to make a really nice project. Imagine what would be possible if you keep learning all of them?"_
>
> by **Thiago Luiz Pereira**

> _"The final project is a great opportunity to put your knowledge in practice and also to find out how it is to work in team. You will understand how all the different parts such as HTML, CSS, React and Node work together. You will also understand how important it is to have a good planning and to assign different tasks to different members of your team. And once you get into the flow of creating and developing you will suddenly understand how much knowledge you collected and what amazing stuff you are able to do!"_
>
> by **Ion Oaie**

> _"I can describe my experience as team leader for the final migracode project as a perfect “first contact” of what it will be like to work in the tech sector when it comes to making a digital product._&#x20;
>
> _I was lucky enough to have a complete team that made the experience as real as possible, from the design of the user experience to the production process, including the workflows in GIT and the organization of the tasks with SCRUM agile methodologies._&#x20;
>
> _I was able to see first-hand the challenges faced by development teams, which range from optimising the most human aspects (creating team synergies, motivating members or trying to make them understand the product vision) in order to be more efficient and productive, to choosing all the right technologies (stack) and technical processes in order to produce a quality product while wasting the minimum possible resources._&#x20;
>
> _In addition to having a great coordinator who has given us feedback to optimize correctly and professionally all our work._&#x20;
>
> _I consider that I still have a long way to go but in short, this experience has considerably and correctly shortened what could have been something more tedious and disorganised."_
>
> by **Alexei Soliz**
>
> _"It's easy to see how each one of the topics we see throughout the course are useful on their own, and you might even have the right idea about how they will work together in a real project, but implementing them together is a whole different beast, and I'm not only talking about coding here._&#x20;
>
> _I would say that I learned more about every technology while working on the project for the last 6 weeks of the course, but that's not even the most useful thing I learned with it. Besides really learning how a whole stack interacts together, you get to really see how important organization is in a real life coding project. If you're not organized and don't have good communication, you can easily end up with situations like different code that does the same thing throughout the project, you might have to work with your partner's code and don't understand a thing of what they wrote, or simply be overwhelmed by the amount of tasks there are to do._&#x20;
>
> _Another great thing about working on what is akin to a real life project is that you will more clearly identify what you like and what you don't, or at least that's what happened to me. You're putting the effort to be a Full Stack Webdev, but in reality you might just like frontend or backend more, and the only way to truly know that is by implementing those things in real apps. I for one learned that I actually like working on the whole stack, but I really don't like CSS and styling, so backend might be the best option for me._&#x20;
>
> _If you get through the project with a result you like, you're pretty much ready to take onto any challenge that the job market presents to you as a junior, so just keep pushing, because the final project is probably the hardest part of the course but also the most rewarding one."_
