## How to ask for help in #support-coding

#### **How to ask for help**

When you ask something here, always make sure that you:

* Describe what you are trying to do/achieve, and in which exercise/project
* Include details about what you have tried already
* Write your question in a clear and understandable way (preferably in English, but in Spanish is also allowed)
* Include the relevant parts of the code where you are getting the error/issue and **always include any error codes** you have received
* Use code snippets **(ctrl / cmd + shift + c)** to share your code to make it readable for humans
* Use **(shift + enter)** to pass to the next line

#### **Question templates**

In case you receive errors or things that go wrong during exercises, so short questions that can probably be solved in a chat, you can write your question as follows:

* _Hello + I need help with \[issue description] + screenshot/error message/etc. + what you have already tried to do + potential solutions you already found._

If you feel lost, if you missed things or if you need some extra support in understand the materials, you can write your question as follows:

* _Hello + I need help with \[issue description] + proposal for time period you could have a call._

## Useful Slack tips
