# Self-branding

## **Introduction**

**To start: being visible online is a MUST, for recruiters to find you while at the same time being able to apply for jobs directly. If you're shy to promote yourself, **_**you need to let it go**_**, at least while you are searching for jobs and building a professional network online! We consider three types of profiles a must: LinkedIn, GitHub and a self-developed one (a webpage). Find more information below for each profile type.**
