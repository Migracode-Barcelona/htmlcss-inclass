# Self-developed profile

## Introduction

**While LinkedIn and GitHub are great to present yourself and promote your skills and experience, the most impressive thing to send to a recruiter is your own developed webpage with your portfolio and other relevant information. Not only will it show great motivation, but by making a great webpage, your profile itself is already showing your skills!**

## Some general advice

* IF you make your own profile page, make sure to have enough coding knowledge to make a really good one. If you just started coding, wait a little while. It's better to just have LinkedIn and GitHub than having a super basic HTML/CSS self-developed profile.&#x20;
* Once created, make sure to have other developers take a look at your page to receive proper feedback, so you can really finetune both the layout as well as the code itself.
* Any self-developer profile needs to have the following key-information:
  1. Who you are
  2. What you do
  3. Your location
  4. The work you have to share
  5. How to contact you&#x20;
