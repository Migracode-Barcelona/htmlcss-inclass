# Volunteer Support

It is important to know that we have a huge volunteering-community ready to support you in becoming a software developer. Therefore, do not hesitate to request a one-two-one session if you feel lost with the materials, you are behind or you just need some extra explanations about the materials.  You can also ask someone to help you with the job search (later on the course).

* **Homework support**\
  ****If you are stuck with homework, do not hesitate to ask your questions in the #support-coding channel (for the Web Development Course) or #support-it (for the IT Support & Security Course) on Slack. There are many volunteers to help you and please note: there are no weird or stupid questions!&#x20;
* **CV/LinkedIn support/Job Preparation**\
  ****If you need help with creating or further developing your CV or LinkedIn or get help with preparing your job interview, please make use of the #support-employability channel on Slack to ask help from our volunteers to check your CV or LinkedIn or even make an appointment with them to improve it.
