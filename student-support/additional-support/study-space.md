# Study space

**We have two options if you cannot study well at home. Both options are free and can be used based on availability. All you need to do is sign-up accordingly beforehand and be there.**

## Study at the office of Porsche Digital

You can study for free at the fancy and nice office of PORSCHE DIGITAL in the center of Barcelona, between Monday and Friday from 10:00 to 18:00. Exact location [here](https://goo.gl/maps/Gah7BuanPTpiURRF6).&#x20;

Every week, you need to sign-up before Thursday evening through [this form](https://airtable.com/shr0IFmWNe1EpF8Bk) to reserve your spot(s) for the next week. You will receive your QR code on Friday which you will need to bring when you come to the allocated day/time.

{% hint style="info" %}
**IMPORTANT: If you reserve a spot, they expect you to come (as you may take someone else's spot, it's a small office), so make sure to inform me at least one day in advance in case you cannot make it after all.**
{% endhint %}

## **Study at our Open Cultural Center space**

You can also come to study at our own center in El Born, over [here](https://g.page/OpenCulturalCenter?share). We are open Tuesday to Friday, from 10:00 to 16:00. It may be a bit noisy from the street but we have a nice room where you can study with steady internet.

To sign up, just write Vincent + Diana on Slack to let us know when you want to come.&#x20;
