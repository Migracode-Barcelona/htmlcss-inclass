You will be invited to the **Language Lab Slack** workspace, which is where all communication between students, teachers, and the Language Lab team takes place.

## Language exchange events

Follow [Open Cultural Center on Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/open-cultural-center-barcelona/) to hear about the events organised by the Language Lab. In general, there are 2 language exchanges every month, and these events are open to everyone.&#x20;

For reminders and practical information about language exchanges, join the [Language Lab WhatsApp group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/CvwADRZ0mGEGWq4hqxh3ml).

If you are in the Language Lab Slack, you can also check the #exchange channel.

## Language Buddies

Through the Language Lab, you can also [register as a Language Buddy](https://airtable.com/shrFaH2cfPBJ22AKA)!

If you would like to practice a language with a native speaker**,** improve your language skills through one-on-one conversations, or help someone else with the language they are learning, this is a great option.

You will be matched with someone else from the Language Lab's multicultural language community, and you can start immediately.
