# Language Support

**English is a global language and is a requirement for many tech jobs in Spain â€“ even if the job is in Spanish. For this reason, students at MigraCode need a minimum level of English to get them through the course. Luckily, you can access free English lessons at the Language Lab and Oxford House!**&#x20;

**Spanish or Catalan are also often a requirement in tech jobs in Barcelona. The Language Lab also offers lessons for local languages, so you can get the support you need!**

## **Where and how?**

**Open Cultural Center**, our host organization, offers free language lessons at the [**Language Lab**](https://openculturalcenter.org/language-lab/). You can join **Spanish, English, Arabic and Catalan classes** taught by dedicated native-speaking volunteers, and be part of an amazingly diverse community. There are 2 levels for each language: beginner (A1 - A2) and intermediate (B1 - B2). The Language Lab also organises **language exchange events**, and runs **Language Buddies**, so you can practice in many different ways according to your preference!

Additionally, we have a collaboration with **Oxford House**, a language school in Barcelona that offers free **English classes** to MigraCode students via their [English Eco](https://oxfordhousebcn.com/en/english-courses/economic-english/) course. These courses are run by teachers in training from their [Cambridge CELTA](https://www.oxfordtefl.com/oxford-tefl-courses/cambridge-celta/cambridge-celta-100-online/) course. They last 3 months and are a great way to practise different skills while listening to different accents, and meeting people from all over the world.&#x20;
