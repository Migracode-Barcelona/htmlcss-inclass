## **Safeguarding**

We do not tolerate harassment of community participants in any form, and sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any community activity.**

### **Your role as a student**

**We believe that everyone can be a developer. Becoming a successful developer is all about practice, dedication, and willingness to learn. We believe that you can graduate from Migracode with new skills to help you start your career in IT, but it will take hard work and dedication. We know you can do it!**

#### Practice

This means being a student is now your part-time job. You will need to attend classes and do homework for about 25-30 hours a week to achieve the learning goals of your Migracode course. This is about the same as a part-time job. Please think carefully about whether this is a realistic time commitment, and what your priorities are right now. Talk to one of the Migracode teams if you have any concerns.

#### Dedication

You show dedication to becoming a developer by attending every class. We invite you to bring your homework to discuss it with your peers. If you do not come prepared, you risk being unable to follow the class. It is important to try to attend all the classes, and complete the homework, so that you can discuss it with the other learners during class. If something happens that means you cannot do your homework or come to class, please let us know. Completing the course successfully will be difficult if you miss classes, but we want to work with you to help you succeed!

#### Willingness to Learn

MigraCode is not just an average school. Our passionate developers dedicate their free time to support your career. We would like you to see taking advantage of it and try together. You are encouraged to study hard, ask lots of questions, and always show up on time. Finally, respect is at the core of the MigraCode community. As a student, you show respect and willingness to learn from both your teachers and peers. We see our diversity as an asset and invite you to do the same. Migracode is a non-profit project, and your teachers are unpaid volunteers. We are really pleased that you want to join this learning community! Your teachers are passionate about your learning, and we want you to benefit as much as possible from their knowledge.

### Missing a class or being late

If for some reason you need to miss a class, please always inform Diana, Yogesh AND Vincent with a valid reason (if it is a personal reason, just say that, we do not need to know the details, except if you want to share it with us of course). Make sure to always arrange a one-two-one to replace the class you missed - this is obligated, and needed for you to stay up to date with the course.
