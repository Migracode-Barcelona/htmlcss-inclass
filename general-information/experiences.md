# Experiences

### **Rahaf Bayazi**

#### **MIGRACODE GRADUATE FROM SYRIA**

Thanks to Migracode I have made the professional change I have been looking for a long time ago, It is a great school and the people (Monitors, Managers and other staff) are really the soul of why that is. The people here care, they work hard, they work smart, they genuinely want the students to be successful even beyond the classes.

### **Alexander Ludwick**

#### **EMPLOYABILITY VOLUNTEER & RECRUITMENT SPECIALIST**

I was completely humbled to hear these guys talk about their experiences and their sheer determination to upskill and become valuable, contributing members of society and never have I felt so privileged and lazy! I’m genuinely not sure who learned more.

### **Cristal Bukler**

#### **EMPLOYABILITY VOLUNTEER & HOSPITALITY SPECIALIST**

Working at Migracode means that you not only have the opportunity to teach them how to stand out in the jobs market, but also how to stand out as people. Nothing more rewarding for me than knowing their life stories and providing them valuable resources to train their soft skills in order to conquer their own confidence.

### **Henriette Hettinga**

#### **MIGRACODE INSTRUCTOR & BOOTCAMP GRADUATE**

Many students of Migracode have escaped very difficult circumstances in their home country. They work tremendously hard to improve their knowledge and skills because they know their future depends on their studies. I am impressed with their dedication and hard work. Migracode is literally a life-changing experience for them.

### **Shaheen Akond**

#### **MIGRACODE GRADUATE FROM BANGLADESH**

When I stepped foot on Migracode, I did not imagine that the decision will shape my future. Today, I am proud to say, Migracode has played a leading role in my life and made my dream came true. Thank you for teaching me so much - both about the hard skills and soft skills. To me, our Migracode is a precious thing, a great gift to our community, a great opportunity for immigrant students who came to Spain with a great hope. It is a place of optimism, and transformation.

### **Thiago Luiz Pereira**

#### **MIGRACODE GRADUATE FROM BRAZIL**

After 8 months of course, training about development of skills, employability sessions and differents meet ups. I am feeling glad for I could use all those knowledges learned in Migracode at Webhelp, but it doesn't finish at all, was just one step for a long journey about self and professional development, always having focus to provide the best experience for the costumer and a good environment between my co-workers. Thanks Migracode and Webhelp to work together to make it real.

### **José Arriaga**

#### **MIGRACODE GRADUATE FROM MEXICO**

The start of my collaboration with migracode and the idea of learning code and sharing my thoughts and ideas with my colleagues was exciting, however, after the lockdown it was hard and challenging during the covid. But with the help of the mentors and working with people from different places and backgrounds helped us to strengthen our communication and teamwork. In addition, it was fruitful in many aspects. Rather than learning code, it was a preparation for new challenges in our new normal.

### **Anandamaya Arno**

#### **MIGRACODE GRADUATE FROM VENEZUELA**

Being a part of Migracode has been a life-changing experience in many ways. It's an amazing opportunity to start over and look for opportunities for a better future while it allows you to be a part of an incredible community, and as a migrant, I believe this is an incredible support. The amazing team is there to support you in absolutely anything you need, even if not related to the course itself. I totally thank them for that!

### **Ricardo Delgado**

#### **MIGRACODE GRADUATE FROM VENEZUELA**

My 8 months long learning experience at Migracode tells that it helped me gain my confidence on being a web developer with the knowledge of the latest stacks and tools, which was made possible by the presence of talented and helpful volunteers. The soft skills trainings and the consulting services regarding for any kind of problem is also something that Migracode is and will be special for, just like the way MigraCode is committed to help the students even after the bootcamp.

### **Oleksander Ortsev**

#### **MIGRACODE GRADUATE FROM UKRAINE**

With a fast changing world I decided to focus on the things that should help me in the future. That was one of the main reasons why I applied to the Migracode Programming school, when I came to Barcelona. Within the 8 months programming course, the the whole new tech-world opened for me. I realize that I am still at the very beginning of my journey in this area, but the future has become much more promising.

### **Lavinia Sirbulescu**

#### **MIGRACODE GRADUATE FROM ROMANIA**

There is philosophy in everything MirgraCode is doing for the under-represented community of refugees, migrants, women in tech. This gives them unthinkable power to build bridges and alter the circumstances of those of us in need. They might be young but wise enough to know that with power comes responsibility and they don’t fall short on it. They listen and connect with people. They don’t perform for them. They are genuine community builders. All of it is lived experience that brings meaning to my words.
